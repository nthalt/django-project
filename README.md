# Setup and Installation

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Important Notes:

- Ensure that you have activated the virtual environment before running the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command. This ensures that all dependencies are installed within the virtual environment and do not affect the global Python environment.
